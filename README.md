# Account Unlocker

It basically works like the LockoutStatus.exe tool from Microsoft, but instead of querying every-single-domain-controller (can be painful in a large environment), you can select a specific AD site.  Only the domain controllers in that site will be queried.  

Search... find... right-click... unlock... reset password... etc.
